                A user can also choose to share a playlist with other users by making it collaborative (2). When the owner has made a playlist collaborative, users who have followed the playlist or who have the direct URI to it can see it and add to or remove tracks from it.

                It is important to understand that making a playlist collaborative automatically changes the playlist’s status to “private” — although the collaborators can see the playlist, it is no longer visible to other users. In the Spotify ecosystem there is no concept of group ownership of a playlist; the playlist is always owned by the user who created it. Only that user can decide if the playlist is collaborative or not. In order to be able to read a user’s collaborative playlists the scope playlist-read-collaborative is needed. Note that, when using the Web API, only the owner of a collaborative playlist can make changes to that playlist.
                
                Unchecking the Collaborative Playlist control still leaves the playlist in a “private” state (3). To make the playlist visible to all users, the owner must explicitly set the playlist state back to “public” (4).
                
                In the Spotify Web API, the Create a Playlist endpoint lets you decide whether a newly created playlist should start life as “public” or “private”. You can also change the current public/private status using the Change a Playlist’s Details endpoint. Requests to these endpoints require, of course, the appropriate scopes to have been granted by the user: playlist-modify-public to modify public playlists, and playlist-modify-private to modify private ones.
